My Learnings:

This was a quite interesting task for me to deal with Spring Boot for first time and I enjoyed finding and fixing the error :)

1. As a first step, I thought of understanding how Sprint Boot application works before diving into finding the errors. I found a very nice article on how to build an Application using Spring Boot - https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

2. Then I managed to download all the dependent tools and built a sample Hello SpringBoot application.

3. Built the application using Gradle.

4. I said "Hello" to the "Spring".


Solution:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Dockerfile - contains the build step of the container.

3. Makefile - abstract the steps to run the application inside a container.

4. 

Build Steps:

1. Build the SpringBoot App

```
