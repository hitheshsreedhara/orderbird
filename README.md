Solution:

This was a quite interesting task for me to deal with Spring Boot for first time and I enjoyed finding and fixing the error :)

1. As a first step, I thought of understanding how Sprint Boot application works before diving into finding the errors. I found a very nice article on how to build an Application using Spring Boot - https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

2. Then I managed to download all the dependent tools and built a sample Hello SprinBoot application.

3. Ran the application using Gradle.

4. I said "Hello" to the "World".
